# WebsitePilot

ProofPilot's combined website sales agent. Takes one lead from
discovery to close-ready proof by shipping a bundle: sales audit +
strategy blueprint + live demo homepage + close pitch.

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the pipeline diagram, `skill/SKILL.md` for
the full operating doctrine, and `templates/README.md` for the
style-family design library.

## Local workspaces

Durable WebsitePilot run source lives under `workspaces/` when it needs
to be committed with this agent repo:

- `workspaces/codex/<client-slug>/` — Codex-authored WebsitePilot runs.
- `workspaces/claude/<client-slug>/` — Claude Code / Gemini-authored WebsitePilot runs.

Agent names are only internal workspace lanes. Public preview URLs stay
client-clean, for example `https://demo.proofpilotapps.com/richardson-pest/`.
